## Game Ideas of the members ##

### 63855 Amin M. Quraishi ##
My idea of a game is inspired by a movie I watched called, Free Guy. In the movie, there is an open-world game with AI non-playable characters and they evolve as the game progresses. So if I had all the time and possible resources, I would love to make that game in reality and experience the whole idea. An open-world game filled with AI npcs is just a fascinating idea. I hope that in future, the idea actually comes into reality.

My idea of is inspired by a dream where the villian is very powerfull and no superhero could defeat him. In the game the villian charactor goes through a journey due to which he becomes the person he is and he gains all his powers through the journey.  So if I had all the time and possible resources, I would love to make that game in reality and experience the whole idea. An open-world game filled with AI npcs is just a fascinating idea. I hope that in future, the idea actually comes into reality.
