#### First Idea ####
My idea of a game is inspired by a movie I watched called, Free Guy. In the movie, there is an open-world game with AI non-playable characters and they evolve as the game progresses. So if I had all the time and possible resources, I would love to make that game in reality and experience the whole idea. An open-world game filled with AI npcs is just a fascinating idea. I hope that in future, the idea actually comes into reality.

#### Second Idea ####
My second idea of the game is like temple run. In the game, a player is running and something is chasing the player. The player can collect points while running and there will also be some obstacles that will be appearing in front of the player sporadically.

#### Third Idea ####
My third idea of a game is based on bike riding. A player will be riding a bike on a straight road among other cars. The objective of the game for the player is to drive for as long as the player can while avoiding the other cars. If the player hits the other cars, then the player will die and it will be game over.

#### First Idea ####
My idea of is inspired by a dream where the villian is very powerfull and no superhero could defeat him. In the game the villian charactor goes through a journey due to which he becomes the person he is and he gains all his powers through the journey.  So if I had all the time and possible resources, I would love to make that game in reality and experience the whole idea.
