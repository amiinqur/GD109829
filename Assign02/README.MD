#### First Idea ####
My idea of a game is inspired by a movie I watched called, Free Guy. In the movie, there is an open-world game with AI non-playable characters and they evolve as the game progresses. So if I had all the time and possible resources, I would love to make that game in reality and experience the whole idea. An open-world game filled with AI npcs is just a fascinating idea. I hope that in future, the idea actually comes into reality.

#### Second Idea ####
My second idea of the game is like temple run. In the game, a player is running and something is chasing the player. The player can collect points while running and there will also be some obstacles that will be appearing in front of the player sporadically.

#### Third Idea ####
My third idea of a game is based on bike riding. A player will be riding a bike on a straight road among other cars. The objective of the game for the player is to drive for as long as the player can while avoiding the other cars. If the player hits the other cars, then the player will die and it will be game over.

#### First Idea ####
My idea of is inspired by a dream where the villian is very powerfull and no superhero could defeat him. In the game the villian charactor goes through a journey due to which he becomes the person he is and he gains all his powers through the journey.  So if I had all the time and possible resources, I would love to make that game in reality and experience the whole idea. 

#### Second Idea ####
my second idea is inspired by marvel movie where the player moves on different levels and unlocks different marvel charecters. he can turn turn into different charecter any time through a gadget. The player can also enhance the super hero by selecting it more and more. on different levels different villians from marvel movies fight with the hero. 

#### Third Idea ####

My second idea is like a strategic game like clash of clan where you can train your army and seize the throne from neighboring kingdoms.Train troops and create powerful weapons that lets you create your military base and defend it with your heavily armored troops.Loot resources from the enemy and use them to upgrade your defenses.You can also battle players online and defeat those who stand in your way.

#### Third Idea ####
My third idea is for potential to draw the attention of many in different ages of group either you are 1 year child or you are old age person its always entertaining. There is no doubt that Ludo is popular worldwide. I think of developing a Ludo game with the option of joining through social accounts and offline gaming mode. The feature would help players to play with their friends and family.
