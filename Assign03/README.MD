## Selected Game Idea ##

### We finally went with a game where a character is running while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins on the way. The game is inspired by the famous mobile game called, Temple Run. We needed a object of a character that will be running in the game. We downloaded this character from a website called, Mixamo. It is a great website by Amazon, which provides a lot of characters with numerous animations. We downloaded a character with the running animation and then utilized it in out project. ###
